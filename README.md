# angular-tutorials

Hello and welcome. For your convenience, in this library I included a list of the projects I created in the tutorials and courses to help you learn Angular as well as React related libraries. I encourge you to create the projects yourself and just use this as a reference.  As John Dewey said we learn by doing:
> “We do not learn from experience... we learn from reflecting on experience.” 

If you learning React or interesting of learning React, I invite you to checkout my react-tutorials: https://github.com/EliEladElrom/react-tutorials.

I will be giving away a report about the top libraries you should learn in 2020 that can bust your project and improve your skills and productivity: https://forms.gle/5Va5s9x6NhcWVdn28
